Will we be forgotten? How much can I remember?
November 2023, lhh: Oops, the more I do it, the simpler this set of questions seems.
December 2023: Uh... yeah, the shuttle buses for the two times I went out came back late. Being this late is not acceptable; time management will fail (last time I almost couldn't make it back for cf... this time rushing through the access control... well).
February 2023: Thanks, Tsinghua Yuan! Thanks, Tsinghua Yuan! Thanks, Tsinghua Yuan!
November 2021: I really tried hard, hey (I really don't know why I'm still so bad, and, I've been regressing all along).
November 2019: Before I lose all sense, tonight's wind, please, on my behalf, tell them, tell them I love them, and then let me disappear from their lives. There's nothing I can't let go of; my persistence, my existence, will only harm them... why make innocent people suffer with me?
October 2022: To my parents: Why, whenever something happens, does it have to be said through? I don't know why, but I always feel like being a bad child in front of you. So when I'm a good child, please don't expose me; just treat me like a bad child.
September 2022: The team leader has been chosen, the sun is setting, I'm at a loss for words, desperately holding back tears. Finally, the disbandment arrived. I must, I must stay behind. I turned around as I stopped, the instructor was already walking back. I mustered the courage to shout to the instructor, but he didn't hear. I ran over, shouted again, he turned around, and I hesitated a bit: Can I... apply for extra training?
September 2022: It's late at night, I pick up my headphones, and I hear music. Oh God, it's truly divine. I suddenly feel happy, but it's not exactly happiness, maybe relief or some other emotion. In any case, it's like in the dark, suddenly having someone accompany you.
March 2020: Suddenly received a call from my cousin, a familiar voice calling out a nickname that had been forgotten for many years...
August 2023: I met you.
June 2019: I silently kneel on the books, packing up the books from the past three years, one by one, sorting through my memories. Ah! I remember this test paper... Ah! Who wrote this essay? Why can't I remember... hey, I hold a bunch of books, a bunch of memories, squatting for almost half a day. Hey, they're going from my study to the garage, going to be taken away by the junk collector, but my memories aren't junk... I indulgently look at you all, this group of cuties, about to say goodbye!
February 2021: You should know, I never send mass blessings, so the blessings you receive must be personally typed by me.
February 2022: I look at the world, I smell the scent of incense, everywhere there are incense pillars, and just like every year, I remember the incense pillar that fell on the ground that year, burning a patch of grass, so black. The cold wind brushes against my cheeks, my mother tells me to put on my hat, but I don't listen. In this new year, the cold wind is also grieving for the world; only people are laughing in ignorance! Let the cold wind pierce through my whole body! But still, I thank them! If there's enough time, I'd like to write more! Happy New Year, yes, happy new year... thanks to everyone I've met!
We will meet again in the future, right?
